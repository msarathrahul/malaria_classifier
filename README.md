# Cell Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

Welcome to the **Cell Image Classification** project repository! This project focuses on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying cell images into two categories: **infected** and **uninfected**. The goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately detect infected cells, which is particularly important in medical and diagnostic contexts.

## Project Overview

Cell image classification is a significant task in medical image analysis. In this project, we use CNNs to automatically identify whether a cell image is infected or uninfected. We'll take you through the journey of data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and performance analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cell-image-classification.git
   ```

2. **Setup Environment:** Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:
   ```
   cd cell-image-classification
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate (Linux/macOS) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Dataset:** Download the cell image dataset and organize it in the appropriate folder structure as described in the project documentation.

4. **Training:** Train your CNN model using the provided scripts. You can experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques.

5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate your model's performance using various metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, and the F1 score.

6. **Visualization:** Visualize training and testing results using provided plotting scripts.

7. **Documentation:** Review the project documentation to understand each step and explore detailed explanations.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset or instructions on how to download it.
- `models/`: Stores trained model checkpoints.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helper scripts.
- `_plots/`: Folder to store generated plots and visualizations.
