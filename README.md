# Cell Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

Welcome to the **Cell Image Classification** project repository! This project focuses on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying cell images into two categories: **infected** and **uninfected**. The goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately detect infected cells, which is particularly important in medical and diagnostic contexts.

## Project Overview

Cell image classification is a significant task in medical image analysis. In this project, we use CNNs to automatically identify whether a cell image is infected or uninfected. We'll take you through the journey of data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and performance analysis.
